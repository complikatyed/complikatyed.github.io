   <h4>From English Teacher to Web Developer</h4>
    <p >I came to coding when, as a 7th grade English teacher, I realized that designing and creating technology tools had taken over the bulk of my prep time (and become the most fascinating aspect of my job).  While I miss the excitement of my middle school students, I'm completely in love with the many-faceted challenges of full-stack coding.</p>
